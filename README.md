# Angular Boot Camp - in-class demo server

This is the source code for the Angular Boot camp In class demo server. It is
hosted at the following URL; it is not intended, or necessary, for anyone to
install during class themselves.

https://api.angularbootcamp.com/

It consists almost entirely of an installation of the fabulous json-server:

https://github.com/typicode/json-server

It is populated with a mix of approximately the same data as "jsonplaceholder":

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

...supplemented with additional data suitable to use for some in-class examples.

It runs via Google App Engine, which should generally keep it up and running
with good reliability.
